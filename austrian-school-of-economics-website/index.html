                <p class=" description"> The Austrian School is a school of economic thought that is based
                    on methodological individualism – the concept that social phenomena result from the motivations
                    and actions of individuals.It originated in late-19th and early-20th century Vienna with the
                    work of Carl Menger, Eugen Böhm von Bawerk, Friedrich von Wieser, and others. </p>
                <p>It was
                    methodologically opposed to the Prussian Historical School (in a dispute known
                    as Methodenstreit). Current-day economists working in this tradition are located in many
                    different countries, but their work is still referred to as Austrian economics.</p>

                    Among the theoretical contributions of the early years of the Austrian School are the subjective
                    theory of value, marginalism in price theory, and the formulation of the economic calculation
                    problem, each of which has become an accepted part of mainstream economics.

                    Since the mid-20th century, many economists have been critical of the modern day Austrian School and
                    consider its rejection of econometrics and aggregate macroeconomicanalysis to be outside mainstream
                    economic theory, or "heterodox". Austrians are likewise critical of mainstream economics.Although
                    the Austrian School has been considered heterodox since the late 1930s, it attracted renewed
                    interest in the 1970s, after Friedrich Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic
                    Sciences.

                <h2 class="">Etymology</h2>

                <p> The Austrian School owes its name to members of the German historical school of economics, who argued
                    against the Austrians during the late-19th century Methodenstreit("methodology struggle"), in which the
                    Austrians defended the role of theory in economics as distinct from the study or compilation of historical
                    circumstance. </p>
                <p> In 1883, Menger published Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special
                    Reference to Economics, which attacked the methods of the Historical school. Gustav von Schmoller, a leader
                    of the Historical school, responded with an unfavorable review, coining the term "Austrian School" in an
                    attempt to characterize the school as outcast and provincial. The label endured and was adopted by the
                    adherents themselves.</p>






                <h2>First Wave</h2>
                <p> The school originated in Vienna, in the Austrian Empire. Carl Menger's 1871 book, Principles of Economics,
                    is generally considered the founding of the Austrian School. The book was one of the first modern treatises
                    to advance the theory of marginal utility. </p>
                <p>The Austrian School was one of three founding currents of the
                    marginalist revolution of the 1870s, with its major contribution being the introduction of the subjectivist
                    approach in economics. While marginalism was generally influential, there was also a more
                    specific school that began to coalesce around Menger's work, which came to be known as the "Psychological
                    School", "Vienna School", or "Austrian School".</p>

                <p> Menger's contributions to economic theory were closely followed by those of Eugen Böhm von
                    Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser. These three economists became what is known as the "first wave" of the
                    Austrian School. Böhm-Bawerk wrote extensive critiques of Karl Marx in the 1880s and 1890s, as was part of
                    the Austrians' participation in the late 19th-century Methodenstreit, during which they attacked
                    the Hegelian doctrines of the Historical School.</p>

                <h2>Early twentieth century</h2>
                <p> <b>Frank Albert Fetter</b> (1863–1949) was a leader in the United States of Austrian thought; he obtained his PhD
                    in 1894 from the University of Halle and then was made Professor of Political Economy and Finance
                    at Cornell in 1901. Several important Austrian economists trained at the University of Vienna in the 1920s
                    and later participated in <b>private seminars</b> held by Ludwig von Mises. These included Gottfried
                    Haberler, Friedrich Hayek, Fritz Machlup, Karl Menger (son of Carl Menger), Oskar Morgenstern, Paul
                    Rosenstein-Rodan Abraham Wald, among others.</p>


                <h2>Later twentieth century</h2>
                <p>By the mid-1930s, most economists had embraced what they considered the important contributions of the early
                    Austrians. <b>Fritz Machlup</b> quoted Hayek's statement, "the greatest success of a school is that it stops
                    existing because its fundamental teachings have become parts of the general body of commonly accepted
                    thought". Sometime during the middle of the twentieth century, Austrian economics became disregarded or
                    derided by mainstream economists because it rejected model building, and mathematical and statistical
                    methods in the study of economics. Mises' student, Israel Kirznerrecalled that in 1954, when Kirzner was
                    pursuing his PhD, there was no separate Austrian School as such. When Kirzner was deciding which graduate
                    school to attend, Mises had advised him to <b>accept an offer of admission</b> at Johns Hopkins because it was a
                    prestigious university and Fritz Machluptaught there.</p>

                <p> After the 1940s, Austrian economics can be divided into two schools of economic thought, and the school
                    "split" to some degree in the late 20th century. One camp of Austrians, exemplified by Mises, regards
                    neoclassical methodology to be irredeemably flawed; the other camp, exemplified by Friedrich Hayek, accepts
                    a large part of neoclassical methodology and is more accepting of government intervention in the economy.
                    <b>Henry Hazlitt </b>wrote economics columns and editorials for a number of publications and wrote many books on
                    the topic of Austrian economics from the 1930s to the 1980s. Hazlitt's thinking was influenced by Mises. His
                    book Economics in One Lesson (1946) sold over a million copies, and he is also known for The Failure of the
                    "New Economics"(1959), a line-by-line critique of John Maynard Keynes's General Theory.</p>
                <p> The reputation of the Austrian School rose in the late 20th century due in part to the work of Israel
                    Kirzner and Ludwig Lachmann at New York University, and to renewed public awareness of the work of Hayek
                    after he won the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Hayek's work was influential in the revival
                    of laissez-faire thought in the 20th century.</p>

                <h2>Split among contemporary Austrians</h2>
                <p> According to economist <b>Bryan Caplan</b>, by the late twentieth century, a split had developed among those who
                    self-identify with the Austrian School. One group, building on the work of Hayek, follows the broad
                    framework of mainstream neoclassical economics, including its use of <b>mathematical models and general
                    equilibrium</b>, and brings a critical perspective to mainstream methodology merely influenced by the Austrian
                    notions such as the economic calculation problemand the independent role of logical reasoning in developing
                    economic theory.</p>
                <p> A second group, following Mises and Rothbard, rejects the neoclassical theories of consumer and welfare
                    economics, dismisses empirical methods and mathematical and statistical models as inapplicable to economic
                    science, and asserts that economic theory went entirely astray in the twentieth century; they offer the
                    Misesian view as a radical alternative paradigm to mainstream theory. Caplan wrote that if <b>"Mises and
                    Rothbard are right, then [mainstream] economics is wrong; but if Hayek is right, then mainstream economics
                    merely needs to adjust its focus"</b> .</p>
                <p> Economist Leland Yeager discussed the late twentieth century rift and referred to a discussion written by
                    Murray Rothbard, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Joseph Salerno, and others in which they attack and disparage Hayek.
                    Yeager stated, <b>"To try to drive a wedge between Mises and Hayek on [the role of knowledge in economic
                    calculation], especially to the disparagement of Hayek, is unfair to these two great men, unfaithful to the
                    history of economic thought"</b>  and went on to call the rift subversive to economic analysis and the historical
                    understanding of the fall of Eastern European communism.

                <p> In a 1999 book published by the Ludwig von Mises Institute (Mises Institute), Hans-Hermann Hoppe
                    asserted that Murray Rothbard was the leader of the "mainstream within Austrian Economics" and contrasted
                    Rothbard with Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek, whom he identified as a British empiricist and an opponent of
                    the thought of Mises and Rothbard. Hoppe acknowledged that Hayek was the most prominent Austrian economist
                    within academia, but stated that Hayek was an opponent of the Austrian tradition which led from Carl Menger
                    and Böhm-Bawerk through Mises to Rothbard. Austrian economist Walter Block says that the "Austrian school"
                    can be distinguished from other schools of economic thought through two categories – economic theory and
                    political theory. According to Block, while Hayek can be considered an "Austrian economist", his views on
                    political theory clash with the libertarian political theory which Block sees as an integral part of the
                    Austrian school.</p>
                <p> However, both criticisms from Hoppe and Block to Hayek seem to apply to the founder of the Austrian School,
                    Carl Menger, too. Hoppe emphasizes that Hayek, which for him is from the English empirical tradition, is an
                    opponent of the supposed rationalist tradition of the Austrian School. However, Carl Menger made strong
                    critiques to rationalism in his works, in similar vein as Hayek's. He emphasized the idea that there are
                    several institutions which were not deliberately created, have a kind of "superior wisdom" and serve
                    important functions to society.He also talked about Burke and the English tradition to sustain these
                    positions.

                <p> Block, when saying that the libertarian political theory is an integral part of the Austrian School, and
                    supposing Hayek is not a libertarian, excludes Menger from the Austrian School too, once Menger seems to
                    defend broader state activity than Hayek – for example, progressive taxation and extensive labour
                    legislation.</p>
                <p> Economists of the Hayekian view are affiliated with the Cato Institute, <b>George Mason University</b> (GMU), and
                    New York University, among other institutions. They include Peter Boettke, Roger Garrison, Steven
                    Horwitz, Peter Leeson and George Reisman. Economists of the Mises–Rothbard view include Walter
                    Block, Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Jesús Huerta de Soto and Robert P. Murphy, each of whom is associated with the
                    Mises Institute and some of them also with academic institutions. According to Murphy, a "truce between
                    (for lack of better terms) the GMU Austro-libertarians and the Auburn Austro-libertarians" was signed around
                    2011.</p>

                <h2> Fundamental tenets</h2>
                <p> In 1981, Fritz Machlup listed the typical views of Austrian economic thinking as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        Methodological individualism: In the explanation of economic phenomena, we have to go back to the
                        actions (or inaction) of individuals; groups or "collectives" cannot act except through the actions
                        of individual members.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Methodological subjectivism: In the explanation of economic phenomena, we have to go back to
                        judgments and choices made by individuals on the basis of whatever knowledge they have or believe to
                        have and whatever expectations they entertain regarding external developments and especially the
                        perceived consequences of their own intended actions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tastes and preferences: Subjective valuations of goods and services determine the demand for them so
                        that their prices are influenced by (actual and potential) consumers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Opportunity costs: The costs with which producers and other economic actors calculate reflect the
                        alternative opportunities that must be foregone; as productive services are employed for one
                        purpose, all alternative uses have to be sacrificed.
                    </li>



                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Marginalism: In all economic designs, the values, costs, revenues, productivity, etc., are
                        determined by the significance of the last unit added to or subtracted from the total.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Time structure of production and consumption: Decisions to save reflect "time preferences" regarding
                        consumption in the immediate, distant, or indefinite future, and investments are made in view of
                        larger outputs expected to be obtained if more time-taking production processes are undertaken.
                    </li>
                    He included two additional tenets held by the Mises branch of Austrian economics:
                    <li>
                        Consumer sovereignty: The influence consumers have on the effective demand for goods and services
                        and, through the prices which result in free competitive markets, on the production plans of
                        producers and investors, is not merely a hard fact but also an important objective, attainable only
                        by complete avoidance of governmental interference with the markets and of restrictions on the
                        freedom of sellers and buyers to follow their own judgment regarding quantities, qualities, and
                        prices of products and services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Political individualism: Only when individuals are given full economic freedom will it be possible
                        to secure political and moral freedom. Restrictions on economic freedom lead, sooner or later, to an
                        extension of the coercive activities of the state into the political domain, undermining and
                        eventually destroying the essential individual liberties which the capitalistic societies were able
                        to attain in the nineteenth century.
                    </li>

                    <p>Liberty. It’s a simple idea and the linchpin of a complex system of values and practices: justice, prosperity, responsibility, toleration, cooperation, and peace. Many people believe that liberty is the core political value of modern civilization itself, the one that gives substance and form to all the other values of social life. They’re called libertarians.</p>
